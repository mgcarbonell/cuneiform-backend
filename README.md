# cuneiform

## Introduction

Cuneiform is a journaling site where we provide a prompt or a quote for inspiration. You can jot down your ideas, set your post for the world to see, or just for you. 

Public posts can be commented on, though we will always show the username so it cannot be anonymous.

We hope to foster creative writers, people who wish to jot down their thoughts, and overall contribute to the written world as our namesake did in the 4th millennium BC.

"Openly he spoke out the words in his heart."

\- an Ancient Mesopotamian poem that gives the first known story of the invention of writing, _Enmerkar and the lord of Aratta_.
